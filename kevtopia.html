<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Kevtopia</h1>
<b style="color:#0032fb">_______________________________________</b>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Kevtopia was a small random creative world at first, which then grew in the huge city it is today!</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px">How it began</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px"> One day, I was bored and felt creative. I loaded up a new creative Minecraft world and started building a house with a friend of mine. Then we built a skyscraper to test out our skills. It didn't really look good. This skyscraper is now known as the Kev Cup Secondary Office. Then I got help from some more friends and we then starting constructing more skyscrapers and houses. Before you know it, Kevtopia became a thing!</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Kev Cup Secondary Office</h2>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;">Old Kevtopia</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px">You may know Kevtopia as a super futuristic metro city, but do you know how it was before?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px">Abandoned Kevtopia</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px">Kevtopia used be a super small community with about 8 small buildings. This is still reachable, close to Hank & Frank's Industries skyscrapers. It is now an island that is filled with overgrown trees. It may even be haunted! </p>
